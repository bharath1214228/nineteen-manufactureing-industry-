The homepage avoids the endless scroll that plagues many websites, with benefit-oriented copy that drives the visitor to take action (View Our Products, Talk to an Expert, Join Our Team, etc.).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The site design loads quickly for desktop and mobile devices, and is easy to navigate and search for product information. Each product landing page features extensive technical and visual details that engineers are often searching for to vet vendors for their procurement teams, such as video demos, data sheets, application-specific features and benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.

Services are clearly delineated with different brand colors and icons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This site also includes a <a href=\"https:\/\/careers.gbrx.com\/\">careers landing page<\/a>, with well-placed CTAs (Find Jobs, View All Jobs, etc.) supported by compelling reasons why you should consider Greenbrier as a future employer, from their strong stance on diversity and inclusion to providing opportunities for employee growth and development.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.

The Fairlawn homepage quickly defines who they are and what they do, with a compelling value proposition for why you should consider them for contract metal manufacturing services: \u201cWe are not just a supplier. We are an extension of your success.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also provide specific reasons to believe their value proposition and the benefits to partnering with them, including reduced lead times, mitigated quality issues and lower operating costs.

They also feature a video library of industry-specific product demonstrations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6.

The microsite offers easy-to-find resources to help manufacturers get the most value from their product offerings, from instruction manuals and product training to quick access to technical support and local distributors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tagline and manufacturing imagery quickly implies a clear benefit to browsing Graco\u2019s solutions: \u201cMoving Your Manufacturing Forward.\u201d The supporting copy clarifies key industries served and the most sought-after material options for manufacturing and processing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7.

The concise customer-focused copy quickly clarifies what services and value they offer for busy facility managers or reliability engineers, instead of populating the site with catchy taglines and lengthy lists of all their technical features. In essence, the site is designed to make engineers\u2019 jobs easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8.

The company does a great job of differentiating themselves from other hardware suppliers by emphasizing their nearly 30 years of industry expertise and their massive scale (100,000,000+ units supplied annually).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many of the picks on this list of exceptional manufacturing websites, the site imagery and customer-targeted copy quickly get to the point of what they do, while conveying their unique value proposition.
