In order to reduce ad spend, a growth marketing framework is needed to base marketing efforts on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a framework that works for your business is the first step, and each business&#8217;s framework may look a little different, but when starting out, you can utilize a basic structure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Creating a Growth Marketing Framework<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When developing your framework, you first need to get an idea of your marketing objectives and desired results. Your framework is based on the current position of your company, and your goals and objectives should be tailored to where you&#8217;d like to grow. This provides guidance for your marketing strategy and informs what you aim for and measure against.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After identifying your goals, you can start coming up with ideas for how to meet them. When brainstorming strategies for growth, it&#8217;s vital to prioritize ideas to keep spending at a minimum. Only implement beneficial ideas that are likely to produce desired outcomes. That way, you can maintain focus without additional expenditures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you develop strategies and ideas, you have to begin testing them. When testing marketing strategies, using scientific data analytic methods of hypothesis, methods, supporting information, and qualitative and quantitative data. Using specific metrics can help you measure how effective your ideas really are. Here are a few metrics that may be helpful for logistics companies using growth marketing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Customer Acquisition Costs<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This refers to the cost of attracting and bringing on a new customer, which may include sales interactions and lead-generation efforts. This metric shows you how to attract high-value customers for the lowest cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Customer Lifetime Value<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This refers to the average revenue gained from each customer. Because logistics relies on long-term partnerships and repeat business from the same customer, this is a vital metric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Average Recurring Revenue<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This metric evaluates the worth of a customer in terms of recurring revenue. Volume density is tied to profits for logistics companies, so this metric can give you an idea of how much volume accounts should have and how many customers you need to reach your goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve tested your ideas, you want to utilize <a href=\"https:\/\/industrialstrengthmarketing.com\/services\/analytics-and-insights\/\">data analytics<\/a> to evaluate how your growth strategies are working. As you market your brand and test your strategies, you want to collect and analyze data to determine what areas should be targeted for further development. The metrics mentioned in the previous section can help you measure your progress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you test your ideas and gather your data, you can filter out which ideas are the most efficient and move those ideas onto the next stage: implementation. After your ideas are implemented, you can make any adjustments necessary and continue to monitor the effectiveness of the strategy. This part of the process may take 30\u201390 days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve implemented different strategies, you can go back for another round of analysis to determine the results of the strategies. In some cases, you may need to start the process with a new strategy. The growth marketing method is designed to be repeatable in order to get the best results and most optimized marketing strategies for your business. If you need to run through the model a few times before finding success, that&#8217;s OK! It&#8217;s all part of the experimentation aspect of the model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will You Try Growth Marketing?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve found a strategy that works for your company, you&#8217;re ready to grow!
